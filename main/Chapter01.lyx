 wrote that, at the outset of the second Persian invasion of Greece in the
 early fifth century BCE, the Oracle at Delphi prophesized the following

\begin_layout Standard
Upon receiving this divination, there is no doubt that the Spartans understood
 that their fortunes would likely deteriorate the course of the war, culminating
 in the loss of either their capital city or their king (ultimately, King
 Leonidas, a descendant of Heracles, and three hundred of his men took a
 legendary last stand at Thermopylae on the basis of this prognostication).
 But rather than from the observations of data upon which much of modern
 statistical inference is built, the Spartans learned something about the
 path of their fortunes from an fundamentally uncertain prophecyâ€”what we
 might call today a probabilistic forecast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern-day probabilistic Oracles, though perhaps less prescient than the
 Oracle at Delphi, can be found in great numbers and in a variety of application
s.
 In particular, many of the variables of interest for which these probabilistic
 forecasts are generated can be modeled as stochastic processes.
 For example, central banks around the world survey professional forecasters
 for their expectations of various macroeconomic indicators over time, and
 report the distribution of their responses.
 The prices of options imply market-determined distributions over the price
 of the underlying security at discrete points in time (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "breeden-litzenberger-1978"

\end_inset

), and metereological scientists increasingly offer probabilistic forecasts
 of everything from the path of cyclones to next-day humidity and temperature
 levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis answers two questions that can be asked of a given stochastic
 process when it is conditioned (in some sense to be made precise in the
 next chapter) to follow a given distribution at discrete future points
 in time.
 The first is a question of inference: Can we, given such a conditioning,
 conduct inference on the parameters underlying the process, and if so,
 how? The second is a question of imputation: Given a set of parameters,
 how can we impute the distribution of the process in between the times
 at which it is conditioned? In intuitive terms, we ask whether and how,
 given the Delphic prophecy, the Spartans could have learned about the dynamics
 under which their fortunes would evolve over the course of the war, and
 how they might have been able to trace out the probabilistic path of their
 fortunes over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will soon see that these two questions are deeply related, and that the
 answer to either depends intimately on the other.

Contributions and Related Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the theoretical portion of this thesis, we propose a natural generalization
 of the theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) over discretely observed
 data from continuous-time stochastic processes, which begins with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "rao-1988"

\end_inset

 in general and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "yoshida-1992"

\end_inset

 for the specific case of diffusion processes.
 In particular, we consider an analog of MLE when conditioning on the distributi
on of, as opposed to observations of, a diffusion process at discrete points
 in time.
 We offer an interpretation of such a procedure as the limiting case of
 MLE under model misspecification, and develop a simulation-based inference
 technique to conduct this generalized MLE procedure, building on the work
 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "roberts-stramer-2001,beskos-2006"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bladt-sorensen-2014"

\end_inset

.
 This partially answers the question of inference; however, the procedure
 requires the ability to simulate a particular generalized notion of a diffusion
 bridge.
 We therefore connect the literature surrounding the simulation of diffusion
 bridges (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "papa-roberts-2012,bladt-sorensen-2014,bladt-finch-sorenson-2015"

\end_inset

) with the literature on generalized bridges (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "baudoin-2002"

\end_inset

) by proposing an approximate and exact simulation strategy for a particular
 class of generalized bridges, answering the question of imputation and
 completing our answer to the question of inference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the empirical portion of this thesis, we validate the correctness of
 the exact generalized bridge sampler and demonstrate that the approximate
 sampler offers qualitatively high quality samples at a fraction of the
 computation cost of the exact sampler.
 We also show that these samplers are robust to a variety of assumptions
 in the proof of their correctness.
 Then, we demonstrate that the proposed simulation-based inference technique
 on distributional data is consistent and also robust to various assumptions.
 Finally, we use the proposed inference scheme to estimate the parameters
 underlying the predictions of professional macroeconomic forecasters.
 Using the estimated parameters, we are therefore able to impute a continuous
 probabilistic path over the horizon of the forecasts, which as the number
 of economists surveyed goes to infinity, minimizes its Kullback-Liebler
 divergence from the forecasts at the relevant discrete points in time.

 given, with emphasis on Markov bridges and the generalized bridges of

\begin_layout Standard
With the mathematical underpinnings set, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 will focus on the theoretical aspects of the thesis.
 The general problem of conducting inference on data in the form of distribution
s is introduced and formalized in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:EM"

\end_inset

.
 A procedure for conducting inference is developed and an interpretation
 of such a procedure as being a limited case of MLE on a misspecified model
 is also given.
 An expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to address the problem
 of intractable transition densities for most diffusion processes.
 However, the need to exactly sample generalized diffusion bridges becomes
 apparent if we wish to be able to carry out such an EM algorithm under
 Monte Carlo framework.
 As such, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "chap:4"

\end_inset

, a simulation strategy for approximate and exact generalized diffusion
 bridges of this sort is given, as well as the marginal density of such
 a bridge.
